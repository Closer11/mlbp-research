The codebase and datasets for a research paper on the Multi-Level Bin Packing problem.
The algorithms were implemented in C++ and make use of IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimisation Studio.
Scripts for generating the datasets were written in Python.

This research was performed as part of the Research Project of the TU Delft CSE bachelor programme of 2021/2022 (https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project)
under the supervision of Dr. Matthias Horn and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Neil Yorke-Smith.
